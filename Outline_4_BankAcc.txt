#call this a read me 

I gott think tank this
1.)Get the name:
    Try and break it up into first last and a whole name
    I wanna store this data in an array and be able to grab it
    Also I need to make it search for new user and pull-up account info
2.) I wanna make a AccNum Generator:
   Jus In case it is a new user
3.)I want to be able to output AccNfo, on command(just one line/whole sheet)
4.)I wanna be able to add newAccNfo, and be able to modify exsiting data
5.)Im going to have to make a diffrent file .txt that will hold the info
