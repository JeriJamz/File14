selection logic(bools, ifs,else)
Boolean:
    #fun fact this is named after an english mathmaticians(George Boole)
    True or false 
    there are relational expression are boolean expression( equal to, greater than, etc, etc...)
    here are some relation expression in C:
        ==(equal to)
        !=(not equal to)
        >(greater than)
        >=(greater than equal too)
        <(less than)
        <=(less than equal too)
    is normally used to control flow of program 
    #ngl boolean and if statments is what really makes programs go so i get how it control the flow. its like it control the conditions and move off the conditon of true or false 
    !!! Relational expression create simple conditions 


#*
    important note:
        C doesnt really have a true or false boolean but it uses numeric values instead:
            its true if it isnt a non-zero and false if it is a zero

AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!):
    (Line 16) creates compound conditions
    #idea: can set ranges in things 
    for compound conditions statements:
        x >= 1 && <=100 isnt really right but:
            (x>= 1) && (<=100) is
        execpt not(written like this);
            !( n>= && n <=12 )
if Statment:
    if statments has something called pseudocode:
        it almost seem like pseudocode are arguements but with extra steps
    if statment{xray}:
        if(<conditions>) <statment>
