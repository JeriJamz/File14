Cnotes 6:
back to the Cnotes
Read data from a file
C can read other source files(kinda like the stdin.h)#apparently this refers to the keyboard and out refers to the mointer
the file can be accessed without user intervention:
    refered to as batch mode
it possible to reassign the stdin to a diffrent input:
    assign it to a diffrent .txt file so i can be read and input
    #depends on the compiler so |    !!!caution!!!      |
This file in from the book should wrk wit any C program:
    import read_file_skel():
        FILE * in;       #this reads the file
        in = fopen("input.txt","r");        #tell C to read\
        #FILE * in = fopen("input.txt","r");This does the same as the top two lns
        #pretend its in C:\testdata\input.txt
        FILE * in =  fopen("E:\\input.txt", "r");
    exit()
FILE * in:
    file must be in all caps
in = fopen("input.txt", "r"):
    this is the function that open and reads files#well the r is what tells it to read 
    #"w" means write
one all that is done the data pointer will be pointed at the beginning of the file
FILE * in =  fopen("C:\\testdata\\input.txt","r");:
    is also a way to read the file
if the data is on a flash drive use:
    FILE * in = fopen("E:\\input.txt","r");
#*Idk if i noted this already but you can have output(Like a screen) written on anything it can be written on(Including website :)*#
*fscanf:
    "R" tells see to prep for reading. fscanf is what actally reads
    Its just like scanf but the first argument is the file pointer in:
        import Ex()>
            if you have an int value write it like(
            fscanf(in, "%d", &num);)
            ima assume for string value(
            fscanf(in, "%d", string);)
        Exit()
    after you are done reading data from a file use the fclose() methods:
        fclose(in);
    #*remember the file pointer is a method(kinda a function(fancy method)). When trying to read a diffrent file
    just replace the first argument*#
    #*
            ********SIDE NOTE********
            So after the File * method has been used you can't redeclare it
            but I think you can in = fopen() to read another file 
                                    *#
