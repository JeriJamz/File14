Third cup of Java:
Making an Obj:
    There are Three Steps to making an Obj:
        Declaration: A Vari Declaration with a Vari name with the obj type
        Instantaion: The 'new' Keyword is used to create the obj
        Initialization: The 'new' Keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This __init__ the new obj

Source File Declaration Rules:
    Rules for declaring class, import and export statements:
        (1)There can only be one public class per source File
        (2)A source file can have Multiple Non-public classes
        (3)The public name should be the same as the file name w\.java
        (4)If the class is in a package then the package statement should be made first
        (5)if the import statement are present you must put the, in between The package statment and the class Declaration:
            if there are no import statement then the package statement should be at the top
        (6)Import and Package statements will imply to all present classes in the source File:
            it is not possible to declare diffrent import and/or packages in the source file
        
    Classes can have diffrent access lvl, and types:
        Abstract classes,
        finally Final Class
        etc more in later notes
        Also there are Inner and Anonymous Classes

Java Packages
    Packages make it easier to streamline this orgainized spagitti code

Import Statement:
    This tell the compiler where to look for certain classes

*Java Basic datatypes
There are two data types:
    (1)Primative Datatypes
    (2)Refernce/Object Datatypes

Primative datatypes:
    There are 8 Primative types supported by java:#like keywords
        (1)Byte:
            8-bit stack
            minimum value is -128(-2^7)
            max value is (127(inclusive))(2^7 -1)
            default value is 0
            Byte datatype is used to store large arrays
        (2)Short:
            a 16-bit(2bytes) signed two complent Integer
            min value -32,768 (-2^15)
            max value 32,767(inclusive(2^15 -1))
            This saves memeory like a byte but is twice the size
            default is 0
        (3)int:
            32-bit(4bytes) 2CInt
            min value is -2,147,483,648(-2^31)
            max value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive(2^31 -1))
            int is the defualt data type unless you change it(double words)
            default value is 0
        (4)Long:
            64-bit(8-bit) Sign 2CInt 
            max value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63)
            min value is 9,233,372,036,854,775,807(inclusive(2^63 -1))
            this is more of you need a wider range than int
            defualt value is 0L
        (5)Float:
            32-bit(or less) decimal number. it single percision, and can only hol up to 7-9 placeholder before it broken up or called a double
            this the natural 32 register?(eax???)
            Mainly is used to store very large arrays
            default is 0.0f
            Dont use these for percise values(better for sub counts then a stock-market ticker)
        (6)Double:
            is a double percision that works in the 64-bit, Im pretty sure is in the High-Order in the rax register
            default for deciamls
            dont use this for precise values
            default value is 0.0d
        (7)Boolean:
            boolean types represnt a bit(too the tee, On or off, true or false, you get it)
            more like an intrerrupt flag ngl. but also great for conditional checks so you dont have to set it to 0
            default is false
        (8)Char:
            char datatypes is a single 16-bit Unicode Charcater
            min value '\u0000'(or 0)
            max value '\uffff'(or 65,535 inclusive)
            can store and character value
