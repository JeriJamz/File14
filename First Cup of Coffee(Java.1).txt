First Cup of Coffee(Java.1)
#lol, why am I doing this. This is a special program(I bet it good for web-browser instead of programming stuff)
#*my bad about the side notes but:
    Instead of being this rewritting the Cpu Java Edge is the web.
    Prolly great for making API, web based app, BLOCKCHAINS!!!,
    willing to bet Java Versility makes its top-dog. Willing to bet servers are written in this*#

Java is Obj Oreniented (Oh God, this isn't C, Its a prototype python)
Obj:
    and instance of an class(adj, verbs)#eating, yelling\whispering, color, mood, status
Class:
    A fancy function:(hol up I Got you)
    Imagine an function and all its arguments it can take
    Now Imagine you made a  variable, that can hold arguements that you came up with
    Now that might now sound like a variable anymore, BC it isnt.
    its a user made function I.E A class
Method:
    More like a behavior, This is where the data is stored and manipulated
    Sorta like an arguement that a like more flexiable,
    pretty sure you can make this dynamic and make it into a psudeo-function


Some basic Syntax for Java:
    (1)Java is Case-Sensitive
    (2)Case Name - Nun to crazy. Dont be like me when naming things and make sure there is meaning and can easliy associated
    (3)Method Names - Best things is to have them start lowercase
    (4)Program File name - this should be the same as the file Name
    (5)public static void main(String args[]) - this starts the process of converting Hi-code to Machine-code

Java Identifier:
    Identifier are the technical name for the names used for classes, variables, methods
    They should begin with a letter or a $ or an underscore
    A keyword cannot be an Identifier
    Identifier are case-sensitive

Java Modifiers:
    Access Modifiers:
        default, public, protected, private
    Non-Access Modifiers:
        Final, Abstrasct, strictfp
    #This is just a quick-run-down

Java variable:
    Local variables
    Class variables (Static)
    Instance Variables (Non-Static)

Java Arrays:
    #everyone favorite guest, Go in more detail later

Java Enums:
    This is a relativly new thing
    This is meant to restrict a variable to having only one of a few,
    predefined values
    This supposed to help cutdown on bugs
    #I bet this would be amazing with data validation
    #ngl this feature is awesome

Inheritance:
    An amazing headache, Its a class within a class
    it can inherit arguements from the parent class or it can come-up with it own arguement(that can only be called on when the parent called on#idk)
    existing code is called a superclass
    derived class are called subclass

interfaces:
    Its the name, for how the classes commmunicate
    especially for derived class
