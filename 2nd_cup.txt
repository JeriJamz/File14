2nd cup of Coffee:
This time around gonna talk more about classes and obj
Import OOJ_fun_concepts()>

Objects in Java:
    Obj are somethings that can take on classes. Ik that no help
    think of and dog, and all the ways to describe a dog and the things they can do:
        like, color, breed, name, or can it bark(These are examples or classes)
    This same concepts applies to software too:
        well pretend software is an obj:
            it will need classes like,
            online status,
            How long the user been active,
            When they click on somethings/ which class will be called and executed,
            storing low-volume data,
            The Possibilties are endless
        
Local variables:
    they are defined inside the method, constructors or block
    they will be declared and init inside the method and variable,
    this will be destroyed after the method is complete

Instance Variable:
    These are variables within a class but ourside any method
    I think these can be global variables but they're gonna be associated with parent class no matter what
    
Class Variables:
    These are declared outside within a class outside any method, with static keyword

Constructors:
    Constructor are needed for every class in Java,
    if you don't make one Java will auto make one
    Import Ex()>
        public Puppy(String name){
        //This is a constructors and it has one parameter(name)
        }

Singleton Class:#idk
    The purpose of this is to control obj creation
    limiting the number of obj to one
    The instance of classes will happen only one time(since it only has one obj)
    This usally control access to stuff(servers)
    #side note this is great for servers.
