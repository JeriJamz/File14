This is over Functions and Classes

import Ex()>
    long func (int, double);:
        long - funtion type = type of return value (a str will return str, int return int)
        func - Function Name
        int,double - types of arguements
Exit()<
Declartion:
    function in cpp are a like c. Use the keyword(char, int, double,) then the functions then the arguments
    standard function in Cpp do not have to be declared. (dont ether):
       its usally header files
import Ex()>
    /#/include <cmath>#this is a header file
    this directive has standard funtion (sin(), cos(), pow(),etc),
    you dont have to name these
Exit()<
