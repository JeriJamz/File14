Seq Log:
#scanf and printf are function
scanf:
    scanf gives interactivity on the shell
        user can input something
    formatt specifacation is %d 
    the "&" is to give scanf an adress to grab the info
    it will crash if it doesnt have a int value
read a float variable:
    specifacation %f is how to read floats(not doubles)
reading doubles:
    specifacation "%lf"
    your data will be stored in a 64-bit
    apparently you can use int in the float part =
    you can use int, flt, and dbl just have to specify which type it is 
read strings:
    gets(to be a technical dick its get-s not gets) is one ways to read string values
    %s is the specifacation
    dont add the strcpy
